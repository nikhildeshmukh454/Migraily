            <div class="bg" id="a4" style="background-image: url('/images/Public Buses.jpg');">
                <h2><b>1. Public Buses </b></h2>
            </div>
            <p class="a10">The backbone of Hyderabad's public transport system is its extensive network of buses operated by the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC). With routes covering almost every nook and corner of the city, buses offer an affordable and accessible way to get around. From standard city buses to air-conditioned luxury buses, there's an option for every budget and comfort level.

            <div class="bg" id="a4" style="background-image: url('/images/Hyderabad-Metro.jpg');">
                <h2><b>2. Hyderabad Metro</b></h2>
            </div>
            <p class="a10">The Hyderabad Metro Rail, inaugurated in 2017, has revolutionized the city's transport landscape. It connects various parts of the city, including major business districts and residential areas, providing a fast and efficient mode of travel. With well-maintained stations, air-conditioned coaches, and real-time updates, the metro has become a popular choice for both daily commuters and visitors.

            <h2><b></b></h2>
            <div class="bg" id="a4" style="background-image: url('/images/Public Buses.jpg');">
                <h2><b> 3. Auto-Rickshaws </b></h2>
            </div>
            <p class="a10">
                Auto-rickshaws, or simply "autos," are a quintessential part of Hyderabad's transport system. These three-wheeled vehicles are a convenient and affordable option for short distances. While fares are usually metered, it's advisable to confirm the fare before starting the journey. Autos are especially useful for reaching destinations not directly accessible by buses or metro.

            </div>
            <p class="a10">
                Taxis, including app-based services like Uber and Ola, provide a more comfortable and private mode of transportation. These services are ideal for those who prefer door-to-door convenience and are willing to pay a slightly higher fare. 
            </p>

                <h2><b>5. Cycle-Sharing</b></h2>
            </div>
            <p class="a10">                Hyderabad has embraced the global trend of eco-friendly transportation with cycle-sharing services. These services allow you to rent bicycles at designated points and drop them off at other points across the city. It's a great way to explore the city at your own pace while also contributing to a greener environment.

            <p class="a10">Apart from the metro, Hyderabad is well-connected by rail to other parts of the country. Major railway stations like Secunderabad and Hyderabad Deccan (Nampally) provide connectivity to different regions of India. Trains are a preferred mode of travel for longer distances, and they offer a comfortable and economical option for those looking to explore beyond the city limits.

            </div>
            <p class="a10">Many residents in Hyderabad use their own vehicles for daily commuting. The city has well-maintained roads and highways that connect various parts of the city and beyond. However, traffic congestion during peak hours can be a challenge, so planning your travel timings is essential.
