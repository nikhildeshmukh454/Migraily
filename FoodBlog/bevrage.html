                <h2> Chai</h2></div>
                <p>
                    Tea, or locally known as 'Chai,' is a cherished gem in India, and the tea plantations here are sought after worldwide. Chai holds a special place in the hearts of Indians, as it kickstarts their day and fuels their minds to tackle challenges. Among the various cities, Hyderabad stands out for its famous chai recipe, the Irani Chai or Hyderabi Dum Chai. This delightful chai is prepared with heavy cream and condensed milk, giving it a rich flavor. Traditionally, it used khoya or mawa instead of regular milk and cream, making it uniquely delicious. 
Irani Chai follows an unconventional method of preparation, but the end result is a lip-smacking chai recipe that you must try. To enhance the experience, the famous Osmania biscuit in Hyderabad serves as a perfect partner. These biscuits melt in your mouth after being dipped in the tea, elevating the overall delight. 
For Chai lovers, a visit to Hyderabad's iconic chai spots is a must:
